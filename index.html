		What Is a Front-End Development?
	</p>


	 <p id = "paragraph2">

		Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
		The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
		The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.			This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site.
